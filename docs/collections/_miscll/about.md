Hello! I am a freelance journalist, focussed on things digital; especially digital storytelling and data journalism. I have been a print journalist, involved in newsroom management and content planning. But right from the start of my long career, I have been pursuing interests that were grounded in the digital realm, even before the evolution of data journalism.

I have been keeping track of various aspects of data journalism, including trends, tools, courses, tutorials, data journalists and their work, organisations in the forefront of data journalism for quite a while. I will in the coming days try to filter information and content that I think is useful and relevant and feature those here. 

I hope those who are aiming to make a career of journalism, or those who wish to think of branching out in to data journalism, or taking up projects that require specific data journalism skill sets, will find the site handy. 

This section also contains some information about my [experience and background](/about/story/); to get in touch please check out the [contact page](/about/contact/).
